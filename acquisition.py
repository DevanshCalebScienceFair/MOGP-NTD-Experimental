==============

Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition for multi-objective
molecular Bayesian optimization.

Given the trained multi-output GP (``mogp.py``), this module scores every
candidate molecule by how much it is expected to expand the Pareto front of
the objectives if it were evaluated. EHVI is estimated by Monte Carlo: draw
posterior samples for each candidate, measure each sample's hypervolume
improvement over the current Pareto front, and average.

The objectives (in ``TASK_NAMES`` order) have mixed directions:

    PfDHFR_Docking      -> LOWER is better  (more negative = stronger PARASITE binding)
    hDHFR_Docking       -> HIGHER is better (less negative = WEAK human binding -> selective)
    hERG_Toxicity_Prob  -> LOWER is better  (less cardiotoxic)

``compute_pareto_front`` / ``get_reference_point`` work in ORIGINAL units,
converting to a maximization frame internally by negating "lower is better"
objectives. ``compute_ehvi``, however, scores candidates in the SHARED
normalized [0, 1] maximization frame defined by ``evaluation.py`` (each
objective scaled by fixed library/docking bounds) against the SINGLE fixed
reference point ``evaluation.FIXED_REFERENCE_POINT``. That is deliberate: the
acquisition then optimizes exactly the hypervolume that
``evaluation.compute_hypervolume`` reports, so an objective with a tiny raw
range (hERG probability) actually counts in selection, not just in the score.

The number of objectives is dynamic: a docking objective is all-NaN until the
docking oracle supplies it, so EHVI runs on whichever objective columns actually
carry data (e.g. only hERG before docking, all three once both targets are
docked).
