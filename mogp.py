"""Multi-Output Gaussian Process for molecular property prediction.

This module builds a batch-independent multi-output GP on top of the project's
existing pieces:

  * Morgan fingerprints (``utils/featurize.py``) as the molecular representation.
  * A Tanimoto similarity kernel (``kernel.py``) as the GP covariance over those
    fingerprints.
  * The ADMET oracle (``admet_oracle.ADMETOracle``) that supplies the
    regression/classification targets to learn.

The MOGP places one independent scaled-Tanimoto GP on each objective and packs
them into a single ``MultitaskMultivariateNormal`` so predictions (mean and
per-task uncertainty) come out together. Target columns are always handled in
the fixed order given by ``TASK_NAMES``:
``[Caco2_Permeability, Half_Life, hERG_Toxicity_Prob, PfDHFR_Docking]``.

Run ``python mogp.py`` for a self-contained demo on a handful of known drugs.
