validate_docking.py
===================

Standalone diagnostic: is the PfDHFR docking objective measuring real binding, or
just molecular size / lipophilicity?

AutoDock Vina's scoring function sums per-atom interaction terms, so its scores
drift more negative ("better") for bigger, greasier molecules almost regardless
of complementarity. If our docking objective is dominated by that artifact, then
the whole multi-objective BO pipeline is optimizing molecular weight and logP in
disguise. This script answers the question with five checks and one figure, so a
reader can decide in ~30 seconds whether the docking signal is trustworthy:

  1. Per-molecule MW, logP (Crippen) and heavy-atom count from SMILES (RDKit).
  2. A PfDHFR docking-score sample, preferring molecules already docked (existing
     run outputs, then the persistent docking cache) and only docking fresh to
     top up to --n-sample. The provenance breakdown is printed.
  3. Pearson AND Spearman of MW/logP against BOTH raw docking AND ligand
     efficiency (LE = docking / heavy_atoms), printed side by side so the drop is
     visible at a glance. LE targets SIZE directly and lipophilicity only partly,
     so a residual LE-vs-logP correlation (|r| > ~0.3) is flagged as needing a
     lipophilicity-aware escalation (LLE) rather than declaring victory.
  4. Ligand efficiency (docking score / heavy-atom count) — the standard
     size-debiased view — and how much re-ranking by LE changes the top molecules
     vs the raw score (a remedy, not just a diagnosis).
  5. The four KNOWN_ACTIVES (clinical antifolates, reused from
     validate_known_actives) docked against PfDHFR, each reported as a percentile
     within the library distribution under BOTH raw docking and LE: do real drugs
     rise once size is corrected, or does LE over-correct into tiny fragments?

It imports the pipeline's own docking / library code but MODIFIES NOTHING; it is
a read-only observer that uses the docking cache like every other entry point.

Run ``python validate_docking.py --help`` for options. Docking is expensive, so
the first run on a cold cache will take a while for the fresh top-up docks; every
subsequent run is nearly instant (cache hits).
