=============

The SINGLE source of truth for hypervolume across every method in this project
(the MOGP + EHVI loop and all baselines). Every run — MOGP, random, single-
objective, greedy — must report hypervolume through this module so the numbers
are directly comparable.

The problem this module fixes: previously each method computed its own
reference point from its OWN evaluated data (``acquisition.get_reference_point``
sits the reference just past each method's worst observed value). That makes the
hypervolume unit-free and method-dependent — two methods evaluating the exact
same molecules could report different hypervolumes, and an objective with a tiny
raw range (e.g. hERG probability in [0, 1]) contributes almost nothing next to
docking scores that span ~10 kcal/mol. Neither is acceptable for a fair
comparison.

The fix (mirroring the ``max_ref_point`` idea in GP-MOBO's hypervolume code): a
FIXED, shared frame that never depends on evaluated data.

    1. Per-objective (min, max) bounds are computed ONCE and persisted
       (``compute_objective_bounds`` -> ``evaluation_bounds.json``). Library
       (cheap ADMET) objectives get their bounds from the entire cached library;
       docking objectives get a fixed configurable range (the library is not
       docked up front). Which objective is which comes from
       ``mogp.OBJECTIVE_SOURCES`` — nothing is hard-coded to a column position.
    2. ``normalize`` maps every objective into [0, 1] in a pure MAXIMIZATION
       frame using those bounds, flipping lower-is-better objectives so 1.0 is
       always best. Both docking objectives share the same fixed range, and
       their opposite preferred directions (PfDHFR strong / hDHFR weak) are
       handled purely by their signs.
    3. ``FIXED_REFERENCE_POINT`` is the all-zeros corner of that normalized cube
       — the worst possible point on every objective. It never changes, for any
       method or iteration.
    4. ``compute_hypervolume`` normalizes, takes the non-dominated front, and
       measures its hypervolume against that fixed reference.

Objective order everywhere is ``mogp.TASK_NAMES``:
    [PfDHFR_Docking, hDHFR_Docking, hERG_Toxicity_Prob]
with directions [lower, higher, lower] better. ``add_selectivity_index`` adds a
REPORTED-only Selectivity Index (hDHFR - PfDHFR) that is not a GP objective.
