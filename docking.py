==========

Structure-based binding-affinity oracle for *Plasmodium falciparum*
dihydrofolate reductase (PfDHFR), the validated antimalarial target.

Given a SMILES string this module produces a 3D conformer, docks it into the
PfDHFR active site (PDB 1J3I) with AutoDock Vina, and returns the predicted
binding affinity in **kcal/mol**. Scores are free energies of binding:
*more negative = stronger predicted binding*. A known inhibitor such as
pyrimethamine should reach roughly -7 to -9 kcal/mol, while a non-binder such
as aspirin should score noticeably weaker (less negative).

This file supplies the 4th objective column for the multi-objective GP:
``PfDHFR_Docking``. It is the structure-based counterpart to the property
predictions in ``admet_oracle.py`` and consumes the same SMILES inputs that
``utils/featurize.py`` turns into Morgan fingerprints for ``mogp.py``.

Pipeline per molecule:
    download_protein()  -> 1J3I.pdb        (RCSB)
    prepare_protein()   -> 1J3I_clean.pdb  (strip HETATM/water, keep protein)
    prepare_ligand()    -> ligand.pdbqt    (RDKit 3D embed -> Meeko)
    dock()              -> best affinity   (AutoDock Vina, kcal/mol)

Install (if not already present in the `mogp-drug` conda env):
    # AutoDock Vina CLI on PATH (conda install -c conda-forge vina)
    # pip install meeko
