==========

Structure-based binding-affinity oracle for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR),
docking against a **named** target instead of a single hardcoded one.

Two targets are provided (see ``TARGETS``):

  * ``"PfDHFR"`` — *Plasmodium falciparum* DHFR (PDB 1J3I), the validated
    antimalarial target. We want STRONG binding (very negative kcal/mol).
  * ``"hDHFR"``  — *human* DHFR (PDB 1U72, verified Homo sapiens DHFR ternary
    complex with methotrexate + NADPH). This is the anti-target: we want WEAK
    binding, so a compound is selective for the parasite over the human enzyme.

Given a SMILES string this module produces a 3D conformer, docks it into the
chosen target's active site with AutoDock Vina, and returns the predicted
binding affinity in **kcal/mol** (*more negative = stronger binding*). A known
inhibitor such as pyrimethamine should reach roughly -7 to -9 kcal/mol against
PfDHFR, while a non-binder such as aspirin scores noticeably weaker.

These scores supply the two docking objectives of the multi-objective GP:
``PfDHFR_Docking`` (minimize) and ``hDHFR_Docking`` (maximize -> selectivity).
Both consume the same SMILES inputs that ``utils/featurize.py`` turns into
Morgan fingerprints for ``mogp.py``. Docking cost therefore roughly doubles
(two receptors per molecule) — that is expected.

Pipeline per molecule and target:
    download_protein(target)  -> <PDB>.pdb        (RCSB)
    prepare_protein(target)   -> <PDB>_clean.pdb  (strip HETATM/water)
    prepare_ligand(smiles)    -> ligand.pdbqt     (RDKit 3D embed -> Meeko)
    dock_target(smiles, tgt)  -> best affinity    (AutoDock Vina, kcal/mol)

Prepared receptors are cached per target (``<PDB>_clean.pdbqt``).

Install (if not already present in the `mogp-drug` conda env):
    # AutoDock Vina CLI on PATH (conda install -c conda-forge vina)
    # pip install meeko
