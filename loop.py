=======

Orchestrates the full multi-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) loop for
antimalarial drug discovery against *Plasmodium falciparum* dihydrofolate
reductase (PfDHFR).

Each iteration:
    1. Train the multi-output GP (``mogp.py``) on every molecule evaluated so
       far, across the objectives in ``TASK_NAMES`` (a potency / selectivity /
       safety / ADMET set: [PfDHFR_Docking, hDHFR_Docking, hERG_Toxicity_Prob,
       Caco2_logPapp, Half_Life_hours]).
    2. Score the un-evaluated library with qNEHVI — a grey-box composite
       acquisition that models only the docking objectives and folds in each
       candidate's KNOWN-EXACT ADMET values — and pick a diverse batch
       (``acquisition.select_batch``).
    3. Run the expensive structure-based docking oracle on only that batch,
       against EVERY target (``docking.batch_dock_targets`` — PfDHFR and hDHFR).
       Docking is the costly objective the cheap ADMET / fingerprint features
       (precomputed in ``data.py``) are there to avoid; two targets ~double it.
    4. Append the new evaluations, recompute the Pareto front and hypervolume,
       and record history.

The cheap per-molecule quantities (Morgan fingerprints + the library ADMET
objectives, e.g. hERG) are pulled straight from the cached library built by
``data.py``; the loop never recomputes them. Only the docking objectives are
evaluated on the fly, for the selected batch.

Run ``python loop.py --help`` for the command-line options.
