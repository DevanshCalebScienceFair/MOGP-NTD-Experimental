validate_known_actives.py
=========================

Ground-truth validation of the multi-objective BO loop against KNOWN selective
antifolate antimalarials — the compounds medicinal chemists already accept as
good answers on the potency/selectivity plane. A method that works should
rediscover molecules like these; the ICM (coregionalized) model should do so
with fewer expensive docking calls than the batch-independent baseline, because
it borrows strength across the correlated PfDHFR/hDHFR docking tasks.

The known actives are classic *P. falciparum* DHFR inhibitors. Canonical SMILES
are hardcoded below with their PubChem/ChEMBL source IDs:

    Pyrimethamine — first-line antifolate; wild-type PfDHFR inhibitor.
    Cycloguanil   — active metabolite of proguanil (dihydrotriazine).
    WR99210       — potent inhibitor of pyrimethamine-RESISTANT PfDHFR.
    P218          — rationally designed, PfDHFR-selective clinical candidate.

Three things are reported:

  1. Reference profile (potency/selectivity ground truth): for each known
     compound, its hERG probability from our ADMET oracle and its docking score
     against BOTH PfDHFR and human DHFR, plus the Selectivity Index
     (hDHFR - PfDHFR docking; positive = binds the parasite enzyme more tightly
     than the human one -> selective).

  2. Recovery: for each method's FINAL Pareto front, the maximum Tanimoto
     similarity of any Pareto molecule to each known active, and how many known
     actives are "recovered" (max similarity >= threshold, default 0.4).

  3. Headline: whether the loop rediscovers the known selective antifolates at
     all, and whether the coregionalized model recovers them with fewer docking
     calls (molecules evaluated, in evaluation order) than the independent
     baseline.

Run ``python validate_known_actives.py --help`` for options. Parts 2-3 read a
method's ``pareto_front.csv`` / ``evaluated.csv`` from its results directory, so
they are meaningful only AFTER an ablation run has produced those files; missing
directories are reported and skipped.
