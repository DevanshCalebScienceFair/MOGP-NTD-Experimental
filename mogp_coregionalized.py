"""Coregionalized (ICM) multi-output Gaussian Process for molecular objectives.

This is an *alternative* to the batch-independent ``mogp.MOGPModel``. Both are
kept side by side so they can be compared in an ablation:

  * ``mogp.MOGPModel`` places one **independent** scaled-Tanimoto GP on each
    objective. Cross-task structure is block-diagonal: learning about one
    objective tells the model nothing about the others.
  * ``MOGPCoregionalized`` (this file) is an **Intrinsic Coregionalization Model
    (ICM)**. It shares a single Tanimoto data kernel across objectives and adds a
    learned, *dense* ``K x K`` task-covariance matrix (via ``IndexKernel``), so
    correlated objectives borrow statistical strength from one another.

Model construction mirrors GPyTorch's standard multitask ICM recipe:

  * data covariance:  ``TanimotoKernel`` over fingerprints
  * task covariance:  ``IndexKernel(num_tasks=K, rank=R)`` -> dense ``K x K``
  * combined:         ``MultitaskKernel(TanimotoKernel(), num_tasks=K, rank=R)``
  * mean:             ``MultitaskMean(ConstantMean(), num_tasks=K)``
  * likelihood:       ``MultitaskGaussianLikelihood(num_tasks=K)``

``train_mogp_coregionalized`` and ``predict_coregionalized`` deliberately expose
the **same signatures and return shapes** as ``mogp.train_mogp`` /
``mogp.predict`` so ``acquisition.py`` and ``loop.py`` can swap models with a
one-line change.

Unlike ``mogp.train_mogp``, this model is trained only on **fully-observed**
molecules (every objective present). That is always the case for docked
molecules inside the BO loop, so no NaN masking is done here; all ``K`` task
columns are trained and every returned column is finite.

Objective order follows ``mogp.TASK_NAMES`` (the single source of truth).

Run ``python mogp_coregionalized.py`` for a self-test that trains on ~30
molecules, prints the learned ``K x K`` task-covariance matrix, and confirms the
strongest off-diagonal term is the PfDHFR/hDHFR pair — the biological
correlation the ICM is meant to exploit: the two dihydrofolate reductases are
homologous, so a molecule that binds one tends to bind the other, which is
exactly why selectivity is hard and why sharing statistical strength across the
two docking tasks helps.
