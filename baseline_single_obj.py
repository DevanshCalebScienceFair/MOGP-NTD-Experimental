baseline_single_obj.py
======================

Single-objective Bayesian optimization baseline for the molecular optimization
pipeline. This is a control that optimizes **only the docking score** (PfDHFR
binding affinity) and ignores ADMET entirely during acquisition.

The structure mirrors ``loop.py`` and ``baseline_random.py``, with one
difference: instead of a multi-output GP + EHVI over all five objectives, this
uses a **single-output GP** (fingerprints -> PfDHFR docking score) and
**Expected Improvement (EI)** as the acquisition function. Selectivity (hDHFR)
and ADMET are never seen by the GP or the acquisition; they are recorded only so
the Pareto front and hypervolume can still be computed across all five
objectives for a fair comparison.

The hypothesis this baseline tests: optimizing PfDHFR potency alone finds strong
parasite binders, but those binders tend to bind human DHFR too (poor
selectivity) and have poor ADMET profiles, so the five-objective Pareto-front
hypervolume should end up *worse* than the true multi-objective (MOGP + EHVI)
loop, even though PfDHFR docking scores themselves look great.

Objective layout (matches ``mogp.TASK_NAMES`` / ``loop.py``):
    Y columns = [PfDHFR_Docking, hDHFR_Docking, hERG_Toxicity_Prob,
                 Caco2_logPapp, Half_Life_hours]
    The three ADMET objectives come from the cached library; the two docking
    objectives are evaluated on the fly for each selected batch (against both
    targets). Only PfDHFR_Docking drives selection — it is the *only* objective
    the GP optimizes.

The single-output GP reuses the same setup as ``mogp.py`` (a scaled Tanimoto
kernel, constant mean, Adam on the exact marginal log-likelihood, per-column
target standardization) but with one task instead of a multitask layout.

Run ``python baseline_single_obj.py --help`` for the command-line options.
